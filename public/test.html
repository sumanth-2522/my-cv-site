                    <h2>Hello!</h2>
                    <p>I am Sumanth. I am from India. I have done most of my education from my home town Visakhapatnam.
                        I was facinated by computers from very early age. So I did BEngg computer science and later went onto 
                        work for few organisations. I have mainly worked in Java, python, and I have experience in frameworks such as
                        Spring boot, JSF etc. Please refer to my <a href="education.html">Education</a> page for full details.
                    </p>
                    <p>My name is Sumanth and I am a student at Staffs uni. </p>

                    </header>
                    <p>I love reading books. I love travelling. I play and follow tennis and cricket and badminton. I some times draw.
                        I love cooking as well. I like to try various dishes. But mostly I love coding. I make applications that help with
                        daily tasks. For example I am working on an application right now which keeps tracks of how much time I am spending on each 
                        module per weekly and monthly bases.
